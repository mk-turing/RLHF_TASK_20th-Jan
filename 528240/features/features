Feature: External API Interaction
  In order to handle API responses correctly
  As a service consumer
  I want to simulate different API scenarios

  Scenario: Successful API call
    Given the API is available
    When I make a request to the external API
    Then I should receive a successful response

  Scenario: API call with failure
    Given the API is down
    When I make a request to the external API
    Then I should receive an error response

  Scenario: API call with latency
    Given the API has a delay
    When I make a request to the external API
    Then I should receive a response after a delay
